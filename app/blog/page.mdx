# The Story So Far: Cybersecurity to Self-Taught Web Development

## Introduction

Hello, everyone! For my first blog post, I wanted to talk about my story so far in my developer journey.

## Background and Discovery

In 2020, I was attending community college, working towards a cybersecurity degree. To be completely honest, I hated it, especially subnetting. What bothered me the most about it was the lack of creative mediums. I wanted to do something different in tech that would allow me to work on more interesting projects. I eventually stumbled across a YouTube video about web development. This would be the catalyst for a journey of realizing what I truly love doing.

## Transition to Web Development

I immediately tried to switch my major from Cybersecurity to Computer Science. Meanwhile, I started to look into learning about how HTML, CSS, and JS work. I then realized how much information about these topics was easily accessible and well-documented, the complete opposite of my experiences in cybersecurity. I kept seeing things about how you can essentially teach yourself computer science, becoming a self-taught developer. This piqued my interest for several reasons: I could learn at my own pace and delve into topics that genuinely intrigued me. Additionally, I could have more control over the pace at which I could turn this into a profession.

## Learning and Projects

I started with Jad Joubran's courses on HTML, CSS, JS, and React, which was a great introduction to these technologies. Afterwards, I started working on projects from Frontend Mentor. After a while, I had a few projects under my belt: a landing page, a tip calculator, and a to-do app. I was feeling pretty confident in my skills and started applying. Let's just say that confidence didn't last very long after that.

## Challenges and Growth

The video made it seem so simple: Learn HTML, CSS, JS -> Get Job. There were many videos all saying the same thing, but I quickly realized that those people were right but also misleading. Sure, I was familiar with web technologies, but I was missing multiple things to set myself apart and be viable as a developer. My original projects were child's toys at best and they were limited to front-end only as I had no experience with backend or testing.

Through trial and error, I learned the importance of clean code, version control, backend technologies, and testing. With each project finished, I gained valuable understanding of software development, getting better at what I do.

## Looking Ahead

As I keep improving my skills and trying out new technologies, I am reminded of the many opportunities that are out there. With every obstacle I overcome and every goal I achieve, I get closer to my dream of making a real difference in software development.
My journey as a self-taught developer has been truly life-changingâ€”a proof of how determination, enthusiasm, and the constant pursuit of knowledge could lead to success. While the future may be uncertain, I'm excited about the adventures that lie ahead.
